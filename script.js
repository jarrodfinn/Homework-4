var quizStart = document.getElementById("#show-quiz");
var set

// add EventListener to "startBtn" to call the startQuiz function

function startQuiz() {
	// runs for loop through questions
	for (var i = 0; i < questions.length; i = i + 1);
}

// How do you deliver this? Here are some guidelines:


// Play proceeds as follows:


// The user arrives at the landing page and is presented with a call-to-action to "Start Quiz." Also note the navigation option to "View Highscores" and the "Time" value set at 0.


// Clicking the "Start Quiz" button presents the user with a series of questions. The timer is initialized with a value and immediately begins countdown.


// Score is calculated by time remaining. Answering quickly and correctly results in a higher score. Answering incorrectly results in a time penalty (for example, 15 seconds are subtracted from time remaining).


// When time runs out and/or all questions are answered, the user is presented with their final score and asked to enter their initials. Their final score and initials are then stored in localStorage.




// Your application should also be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.


// Refer to the animated GIF below for a demonstration of the application functionality.
